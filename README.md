For Our Super Secret Startup <- yup!


For anyone wanting to run the ios app:
  I am using a framework called Restkit in the app, and as of now I can't find a way to add it to our git repo,
  because it is installed as a git submodule in my local workspace.  If you want to build/run the app, you will 
  need to install Restkit manually, and instructions can be found here: 
  https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/wiki/Installing-RestKit-in-Xcode-4.x
